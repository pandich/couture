## ยง EVENT IDENTIFICATION AND MAPPING

Events are identified by the comparing the first event in the stream
to a series of predicates mapped to log formats. The first predicate
to match has its log format applied to the stream. If no predicate
matches, the stream is considered unstructured.

#### JSON?

If JSON is detected, the stream is considered structured and each
mapper is asked if it recognizes the JSON structure.

##### Example

```yaml
logstash:
  format: json
  priority: 100
  predicates:
    "@version": "^1$"
  mapping:
    timestamp: "@timestamp"
    level: level
    application: application
    context: thread_name
    entity: class
    action: method
    line: line_number
    message: message
    error: exception.stacktrace
```

#### Semi-Structured?

All other events are now candidates for semi-structured data datection
and mapping. Each mapper applies one or more regular expressions to
detect the structure of the event.

##### Example

```yaml
aws-billing-report:
  format: text
  priority: 90
  predicates:
    _: "^(?P<message>REPORT (?P<entity>RequestId):\\s+(?P<action>\\S+)\\s+.+)$"
aws-billing-start:
  format: text
  priority: 90
  predicates:
    _: "^(?P<message>START (?P<entity>RequestId):(?P<action>\\s+\\S+).+)$"
aws-billing-end:
  format: text
  priority: 90
  predicates:
    _: "^(?P<message>END (?P<entity>RequestId):\\s+(?P<action>\\S+)\\s+.+)$"
```

#### Unstructured

If no mapper recognizes the event, it is considered unstructured and sent to the
unknown event-type channel. This channel can be dumped to `stderr` by using the
undocumented `--dump-unknown` command.
